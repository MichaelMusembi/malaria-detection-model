    "# Malaria Cell Detection with Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Malaria remains one of the most severe public health challenges worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Caused by the *Plasmodium* parasite and transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, malaria leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, with children under five being the most vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and reducing mortality. Traditional methods, such as microscopic examination of blood smears, are time-consuming, require trained personnel, and are prone to human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated detection of malaria-infected cells using digital microscopy images and deep learning offers a scalable and fast alternative. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning models can learn to identify parasitized cells from healthy ones by extracting complex features from high-dimensional image data, enabling accurate and rapid diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Impacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medical & Public Health:** Reduces diagnostic errors, accelerates treatment initiation, and contributes to malaria control programs.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Automates the labor-intensive process of manual blood smear analysis, allowing laboratory staff to focus on critical tasks.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Can be deployed in resource-limited settings where trained microscopists are scarce, improving healthcare accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the use of classical machine learning models, a custom CNN, and transfer learning with VGG16 to build an automated pipeline for malaria cell detection. The goal is to create a robust, accurate, and generalizable model capable of distinguishing parasitized cells from healthy ones in digital blood smear images."
