## 🔬 Project Overview

Malaria remains one of the most severe public health challenges worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This project leverages **deep learning** and **computer vision** to create an automated system for detecting malaria-infected cells from digital microscopy images of blood smears.

The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to distinguish between **parasitized** and **uninfected** red blood cells, offering a fast, accurate, and scalable alternative to traditional microscopic examination.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Automated Diagnosis**: Reduces human error and diagnostic time
- **Multiple Model Approaches**: Classical ML, Custom CNN, and Transfer Learning with VGG16
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves robust performance on cell classification
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be deployed in resource-limited healthcare settings
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves model robustness through image transformations

## 🚀 Impact & Applications

### Medical & Public Health
- Reduces diagnostic errors and accelerates treatment initiation
- Contributes to malaria control and elimination programs
- Enables early detection for better patient outcomes

### Efficiency & Accessibility
- Automates labor-intensive manual blood smear analysis
- Allows deployment in areas with limited trained microscopists
- Improves healthcare accessibility in resource-constrained settings

## 📊 Dataset
